# üîç Phase 2 ‚Äì Data Analysis (Weeks 5‚Äì10)

**Area**: Data Analysis ‚Äì Applied Practice & Insight Building
**Part of**: _Data Journey Program_
**Objective**: Strengthen analytical thinking through hands-on exploration, KPI design, and real-world questioning. Move from describing data to discovering actionable insights.

---

## üåü Learning Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with confidence
- Create, validate, and refine KPIs and metrics
- Develop habits of structured interpretation and questioning
- Practice transforming raw data into business-relevant findings
- Build communication of insights into workflows

---

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA helps analysts understand data distributions, detect outliers, and spot trends before formal analysis.

Key activities:

- Summarize key stats (mean, median, range)
- Use visuals to explore distributions (histograms, boxplots)
- Identify missing or unusual data
- Ask early questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs surprising?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs consistent?‚Äù

### 2. **KPI Design & Evaluation**

A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) must be:

- **Relevant** to goals
- **Measurable** with available data
- **Clear** and understood by the audience

Explore different types:

- **Lagging indicators** (revenue, churn)
- **Leading indicators** (site visits, engagement rate)

Encourage iteration: test KPIs against real data and refine them.

### 3. **Data Interpretation & Questioning**

Move beyond numbers to ask:

- What story is this data telling?
- Why did this happen?
- What might be influencing this result?

Use a ‚ÄúFive Why‚Äôs‚Äù or root cause technique to go deeper.

### 4. **Insight Communication**

Insights must be understood to be acted on. Train mentees to:

- Write 2‚Äì3 sentence summaries per visual
- Use plain business language
- Include context (‚Äúcompared to last year‚Ä¶‚Äù) and recommendation (‚Äúconsider increasing‚Ä¶‚Äù)

> A strong analysis includes what, why, and so what.

### 5. **Connecting Data to Action**

Bridge the gap between analysis and business decision-making:

- Who is this insight for?
- What could they do differently based on it?
- How confident are we in this conclusion?
