## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **What Makes a Good Analysis?**

A good analysis is one that helps someone make a decision or understand something better. It focuses on:

- Answering a clearly defined question
- Being based on clean, relevant data
- Providing actionable or insightful results

Mentees should start seeing analysis as more than charts ‚Äî it‚Äôs structured thinking driven by a goal.

### 2. **Types of Analysis: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive**

- **Descriptive**: What happened? (e.g., revenue by month)
- **Diagnostic**: Why did it happen? (e.g., drop in sales due to region)
- **Predictive**: What will happen? (e.g., forecasting future sales)
- **Prescriptive**: What should we do? (e.g., increase ad budget)

Most beginner work is descriptive or diagnostic ‚Äî we will focus here.

### 3. **Basic Statistical Concepts**

Essential ideas that help interpret and describe data accurately. These fundamental concepts form the basis for understanding patterns and making informed decisions.

- **Mean (Average)**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values. It gives a central value of the dataset but can be skewed by outliers.

- **Median**: The middle value in a sorted list. Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by extremely high or low values, making it a better measure of central tendency in skewed distributions.

- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset. Useful for understanding common outcomes, especially with categorical data.

- **Standard Deviation**: Measures how much values deviate from the mean. A high standard deviation indicates more variability, while a low one suggests that values are closer to the mean.

- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values. It gives a quick sense of data spread but is sensitive to outliers.

- **Outliers**: Data points that differ significantly from others. Outliers may indicate variability, errors, or interesting anomalies that merit investigation.

- **Distribution**: Describes how data points are spread across values (e.g., normal distribution, skewed, bimodal). Understanding the shape helps with correct interpretation and statistical analysis.

- **Correlation vs. Causation**:

  - **Correlation** means two variables move together (e.g., sales and temperature).
  - **Causation** implies one variable causes the other to change.
  - Just because two things are correlated doesn‚Äôt mean one causes the other ‚Äî a key idea in avoiding incorrect conclusions.

These concepts help analysts avoid misleading interpretations and build trust in their results.

### 4. **Asking the Right Questions**

Good analysts ask specific, outcome-oriented questions:

- "Which region had the biggest sales growth in Q2?"
- "Which product lines are underperforming?"

Help the mentee develop habits of clarity and curiosity.

### 5. **Telling a Story with Data**

Numbers alone are not enough ‚Äî storytelling adds context:

- Use comparisons and trends
- Explain what changed and why
- Always tie findings to the original question
