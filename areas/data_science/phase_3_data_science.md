# üß† Phase 3 ‚Äì Data Science (Weeks 11‚Äì18+)

**Area**: Data Science ‚Äì Project Design, Modeling, and Interpretation
**Part of**: _Data Journey Program_
**Objective**: Apply machine learning skills in an independent project that includes structured modeling, evaluation, and business communication. Emphasize clarity, simplicity, and responsible practice.

---

## üåü Learning Goals

- Design and execute a data science project end-to-end
- Apply best practices in data preparation, feature selection, and model choice
- Evaluate models thoroughly and interpret their implications
- Communicate results effectively to both technical and business audiences
- Practice reproducibility, documentation, and ethical modeling

---

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Project Framing & Scoping**

Define a real-world problem that is suitable for predictive modeling:

- Business impact or stakeholder relevance
- Clearly defined target variable
- Known constraints (data availability, timeline, interpretability)

Draft a 1-pager framing the problem and expected output.

### 2. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**

Prepare data with purpose:

- Clean and impute missing values
- Engineer meaningful features
- Handle skewed distributions or imbalanced classes
- Ensure dataset splitting maintains integrity (e.g., no data leakage)

### 3. **Modeling & Evaluation**

Choose appropriate models based on:

- Interpretability vs accuracy
- Type of task (classification, regression)
- Training time and constraints

Evaluate thoroughly:

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC (classification)
- MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ (regression)
- Confusion matrices, residual plots, feature importance

### 4. **Interpretability & Communication**

A great model is one you can explain. Focus on:

- Explaining features and their roles
- Discussing limitations and assumptions
- Presenting trade-offs (e.g., false positives vs false negatives)

Deliver both a technical notebook and a business-ready summary.

### 5. **Documentation & Ethics**

Reproducibility and responsibility matter:

- Use versioned notebooks or scripts
- Include README and metadata
- Reflect on ethical use, fairness, and limitations
