# üß† Phase 1 ‚Äì Data Science Overview (Weeks 1‚Äì4)

**Area**: Data Science
**Objective**: Provide a broad overview of data science roles, workflows, and concepts, with emphasis on distinguishing it from data analysis and preparing for hands-on exploration in later phases.

---

## üåü Learning Goals

- Understand what data science is and how it differs from data analysis
- Recognize the typical stages of the data science workflow
- Get familiar with common tools and programming languages (e.g., Python, Jupyter)
- Learn the basics of how models work (without diving into math)
- Identify where data science adds value in real-world problems

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **What is Data Science?**

Data science is the discipline of using data to generate insights, make predictions, or automate decision-making. It combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to solve complex problems.

> **Key takeaway**: While data analysis helps describe and explain the past or present, data science often focuses on predicting the future or building intelligent systems.

### 2. **Data Science vs Data Analysis vs Business Intelligence**

- **Data Analysis**: Descriptive; focuses on exploring and summarizing historical data.
- **Business Intelligence (BI)**: Dashboarding and reporting; turns raw data into accessible visual insights for business users.
- **Data Science**: Predictive and prescriptive; applies machine learning to model future outcomes or optimize decisions.

These roles overlap but differ in complexity, tools, and end goals.

### 3. **The Data Science Lifecycle**

Typical stages in a data science project:

1. **Problem Definition** ‚Äì Framing a business question as a data problem.
2. **Data Collection** ‚Äì Gathering relevant data from sources (files, databases, APIs).
3. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Fixing missing, inconsistent, or noisy data.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers.
5. **Modeling** ‚Äì Applying algorithms to build predictive models.
6. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Measuring model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
7. **Deployment** ‚Äì Making the model available to users or systems.
8. **Monitoring** ‚Äì Tracking model accuracy and feedback over time.

### 4. **Common Tools & Languages**

- **Python**: Most widely used for data science due to libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive environment for mixing code, visuals, and documentation.
- **R**: Popular in academia and for statistical analysis.
- **SQL**: Used for querying structured data from databases.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

### 5. **Introduction to Machine Learning**

Machine Learning (ML) allows systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions.

- **Supervised Learning**: Predict known outcomes (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

> Example: Predicting churn (supervised) or segmenting customers (unsupervised).

No math is needed now ‚Äî just an understanding of how and when ML is used.

### 6. **Where Data Science Creates Value**

Data science is used in:

- **Finance** (fraud detection, algorithmic trading)
- **Retail** (recommendation systems, demand forecasting)
- **Healthcare** (diagnosis support, drug discovery)
- **Marketing** (segmentation, customer scoring)

Understanding use cases helps make the field feel more tangible and relevant.
