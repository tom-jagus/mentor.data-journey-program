# üß≠ Phase 2 ‚Äì Methodology & Analytical Maturity (Weeks 5‚Äì10)

**Area**: Methodology & Analytical Maturity
**Part of**: _Data Journey Program_
**Objective**: Move beyond basic methods to more intentional problem-solving strategies, deeper documentation habits, and analytical maturity. Focus on delivering business value with repeatable processes.

---

## üåü Learning Goals

- Apply structured methodologies consistently across tools and tasks
- Practice hypothesis-driven and outcome-oriented analysis
- Strengthen analytical judgment and decision-making skills
- Improve ability to justify methods, communicate assumptions, and weigh trade-offs
- Establish habits of iterative development, retrospection, and refinement

---

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Hypothesis-Driven Thinking**

Start with a clear hypothesis or question:

- ‚ÄúIf customer visits increase, sales should go up.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúRetention is lower in Region B due to poor onboarding.‚Äù

Teach mentees to:

- Phrase falsifiable hypotheses
- Use data to validate or reject
- Document assumptions upfront

> This sharpens focus and builds rigor into analysis.

### 2. **Value-Oriented Prioritization**

Not all questions are equal. Learn to ask:

- Who benefits from this analysis?
- What impact could this have?
- Is this urgent, or just interesting?

Encourage mentees to prioritize work based on value and clarity.

### 3. **Reusability & Modularity in Workflows**

Think like an analyst-developer:

- Modular queries, measures, or code blocks
- Reusable templates (e.g., KPI formulas, EDA checklists)
- Avoid reinventing the wheel ‚Äî standardize where possible

> Document once, use many times.

### 4. **Assumptions, Trade-offs & Justifications**

Analysts must:

- Be clear about what they assumed and why
- Choose methods appropriate to context
- Balance speed, accuracy, and simplicity

> Analytical maturity means knowing there is no perfect answer ‚Äî only informed ones.

### 5. **Retrospectives & Iteration**

Encourage mentees to:

- Review what worked and didn‚Äôt after each project
- Capture lessons, surprises, and next steps
- Track small changes that created big improvements

> Reflection is not an extra step ‚Äî it is the next step.
