## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Asking Better Questions**

Strong analysts know how to ask focused, answerable, and actionable questions.

- Be specific: ‚ÄúWhat caused the Q2 drop in product A‚Äôs sales?‚Äù
- Add context: ‚ÄúThis spike appears after campaign launch ‚Äî coincidence?‚Äù
- Avoid vagueness: ‚ÄúWhy is this broken?‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúWhat error shows up when clicking X?‚Äù

> Skill to build: Framing your question with what you know and what you need.

### 2. **Receiving and Using Feedback**

Growth requires being open to critique and turning it into improvement:

- Ask for feedback early (not just at the end)
- Separate work from self-worth
- Clarify feedback: ‚ÄúCan you give an example?‚Äù
- Keep a log of lessons learned or patterns

> Reflection builds maturity. Encourage mentees to write down what they would do differently next time.

### 3. **Version Control with Git**

While not required for all analysts, Git is increasingly important:

- Track changes and collaborate safely
- Revert mistakes without fear
- Document your intent with commit messages

Introduce core Git concepts:

- `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
- Branching and why it's useful
- GitHub basics (repos, issues, README)

### 4. **Communicating with Stakeholders**

Stakeholder communication is a critical soft skill:

- Avoid jargon, tailor your message
- Speak in terms of business goals or user impact
- Be concise and structured when presenting results

Even a simple project should include a short explanation of:

- The problem
- The approach
- The conclusion

### 5. **Reflective Practice**

Keep a personal log or journal of your thought process:

- What worked well?
- What confused you?
- What would you try differently?

Writing even one sentence per session helps build metacognition and maturity.
