## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. **Communicating with Clarity**

Effective analysts make insights understandable.

- Speak in plain business language
- Structure messages (Context → Insight → Recommendation)
- Tailor content based on the audience

Practice explaining technical outcomes without technical jargon.

### 2. **Giving & Receiving Feedback**

Feedback is a gift — when given well:

- Be specific and kind (Situation → Behavior → Impact)
- Ask for feedback regularly and model openness
- Turn suggestions into experiments, not criticism

Use roleplay to simulate real-world situations.

### 3. **Presentation Skills for Analysts**

Confidence = preparation + practice.

- Build slide decks with one message per slide
- Use storytelling structure (Problem → Approach → Result)
- Practice pacing and tone when presenting visuals

Train mentees to handle live Q\&A and quick demos.

### 4. **Emotional Intelligence at Work**

Key components include:

- **Self-awareness**: Knowing your strengths, stressors, and values
- **Self-regulation**: Managing reactions under pressure
- **Empathy**: Understanding others' perspectives
- **Social skills**: Navigating relationships and team dynamics

Use journaling or short reflections to track emotional patterns.

### 5. **Resilience & Growth Mindset**

Technical work often brings failure and iteration. Build:

- Mindset of learning from mistakes
- Strategies for managing frustration or blocks
- Confidence from progress, not perfection

> “I haven’t mastered it yet” is more powerful than “I can’t do this.”
