# üß± Phase 2 ‚Äì Power BI (Weeks 5‚Äì10)

**Area**: Power BI ‚Äì Tool Mastery & Modeling
**Objective**: Deepen proficiency in Power BI through hands-on modeling, DAX formulas, data relationships, and more complex visuals. Focus on building scalable, performant, and insightful solutions.

## üåü Learning Goals

- Understand and apply star schema modeling concepts
- Write and debug basic to intermediate DAX expressions
- Build relationships between tables and understand filter context
- Use slicers, bookmarks, and interactions to enhance UX
- Apply performance best practices in report and model design

---

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Star Schema & Data Modeling**

A star schema separates fact tables (e.g., sales, transactions) from dimension tables (e.g., customers, dates, products).

> Benefits include improved performance, easier DAX logic, and better scalability.

Key concepts:

- Fact tables: quantitative data (e.g., sales amount)
- Dimension tables: descriptive attributes (e.g., product name, region)
- Relationships: join tables based on keys (one-to-many recommended)
- Avoid bidirectional filters unless absolutely necessary

### 2. **DAX Fundamentals**

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is the formula language in Power BI used for calculated columns, measures, and tables.

Core concepts:

- Calculated columns: row-level operations, stored in memory
- Measures: dynamic calculations, recalculated per filter context
- Aggregations: SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, DISTINCTCOUNT
- Time intelligence: TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATEADD
- CALCULATE: central to modifying filter context

> Emphasize practicing small, testable DAX snippets in real reports.

### 3. **Relationships & Filter Context**

Understanding how filters flow between tables is critical:

- Direction: one-to-many vs many-to-one
- Single vs bidirectional filtering
- Filter context: what filters are active during evaluation?
- Row context: important for calculated columns

> Use the model view and diagram tools to visually inspect table connections.

### 4. **User Interactions: Slicers, Bookmarks, Drillthrough**

Enhance usability by enabling interactive features:

- **Slicers**: Allow filtering by dimensions
- **Bookmarks**: Save report states for storytelling or navigation
- **Drillthrough**: Let users click through to details for a single item

> These tools improve storytelling and end-user control.

### 5. **Performance & Optimization**

Avoid slow or overly complex reports:

- Use proper relationships (avoid many-to-many unless necessary)
- Minimize columns and cardinality in tables
- Prefer measures over calculated columns
- Optimize visuals (limit data categories in charts)
