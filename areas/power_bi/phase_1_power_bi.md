## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to Power BI Ecosystem**

#### Power BI Desktop vs Power BI Service

Power BI Desktop is the authoring tool installed on your computer. It allows users to connect to data, transform it using Power Query, create a data model, and build reports with visuals. Think of it as the workspace where development happens.

Power BI Service is the cloud-based platform where reports and dashboards are published, shared, and consumed. It enables collaboration, scheduled refreshes, app workspaces, and sharing with stakeholders.

> **Key Differences:**
>
> - **Desktop**: Report creation, modeling, Power Query
> - **Service**: Report sharing, dashboards, workspaces, refresh schedules

### 2. **User Interface & Navigation**

Power BI Desktop has three main views:

- **Report View**: Where visuals are built and arranged on pages.
- **Data View**: Allows inspection of the data after transformation.
- **Model View**: Shows relationships between tables and model structure.

The interface also includes:

- **Ribbon**: Common commands (insert visuals, manage data)
- **Fields Pane**: Lists tables, fields, and measures
- **Visualizations Pane**: Select and customize charts and visuals

> Tip: Encourage mentees to explore these panes interactively.

### 3. **Getting Data**

Power BI can connect to many data sources: Excel, CSV, SQL databases, SharePoint, Web APIs, and more.

To get started:

- Use **Home > Get Data** to choose a source
- Connect to a file and preview it before loading or transforming it
- For most formats (e.g., Excel, CSV), you can load the data directly into Power BI or open it in Power Query Editor first

### 4. **Data Transformation with Power Query**

Power Query is the data preparation engine inside Power BI. It allows shaping, cleaning, and transforming raw data before loading it into your data model.

Common transformations include:

- Removing unnecessary rows or columns
- Filtering values
- Changing data types (e.g., text to date)
- Adding calculated columns (e.g., "Profit = Revenue - Cost")

All actions are stored as **steps** in the Query Settings panel, creating a repeatable, auditable data preparation process.

### 5. **Basic Visualizations**

Power BI provides a wide range of visuals out of the box:

- Bar/column charts for comparisons
- Line charts for trends
- Pie/donut charts for parts of whole
- Tables and matrix for detailed data
- Cards for KPIs or summary values

You can drag fields onto the canvas or visual-specific areas (Axis, Legend, Values) to populate visuals. Formatting options allow changes to titles, colors, labels, etc.

### 6. **Publishing to Power BI Service**

Once a report is complete, you can publish it to the Power BI Service by:

1. Signing in to your Power BI account
2. Using **File > Publish > Publish to Power BI**

After publishing:

- View the report online
- Share it with others (depending on licensing)
- Create dashboards using report visuals
- Set up data refreshes if needed

> Note: Sharing and refresh functionality depends on licensing (Pro or Premium).
