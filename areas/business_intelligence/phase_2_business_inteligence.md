# üìä Phase 2 ‚Äì Business Intelligence (Weeks 5‚Äì10)

**Area**: Business Intelligence ‚Äì Structure, Storytelling & Governance
**Part of**: _Data Journey Program_
**Objective**: Deepen understanding of BI systems, report governance, and user-centric design. Shift focus from building reports to building solutions that serve real business decisions at scale.

---

## üåü Learning Goals

- Understand the principles of scalable BI architecture
- Design dashboards that are clear, purposeful, and action-oriented
- Learn to define and document KPIs and data definitions consistently
- Explore the role of BI governance, access, and change management
- Practice stakeholder communication and user feedback loops

---

## üß© Topics Covered

### 1. **BI Architecture & Workflow**

Dive deeper into how data flows across the BI pipeline:

- Source systems ‚Üí ETL/ELT ‚Üí Data warehouse ‚Üí BI tools
- Understand where Power BI fits in: modeling, visualization, sharing

> Introduce concepts like staging layers, semantic layers, and report consumption layers.

### 2. **Purpose-Driven Dashboard Design**

Dashboards should answer specific questions or monitor clear goals.

- Define audience and use case before designing
- Use layout principles (Z-pattern, grouping, emphasis)
- Align visuals with KPI types: trends vs breakdowns vs alerts

Focus on simplicity, speed of interpretation, and low cognitive load.

### 3. **Governance & Standards**

Discuss the need for consistent, reliable, and maintainable BI systems:

- Version control for reports and data models
- Standard naming conventions and definitions
- Access control: who sees what and why?
- Change management: how updates are tested and rolled out

> Include examples of dashboard misuse, misalignment, or poor documentation.

### 4. **User Feedback & Iteration**

BI isn‚Äôt done when the dashboard is published. Teach mentees to:

- Collect user feedback post-release
- Log issues and feature requests
- Run small improvements based on real use

> Use tools like comment tracking or scheduled stakeholder reviews.

### 5. **BI as a Service, Not a Project**

Reframe dashboards as ongoing tools that evolve:

- Create documentation (README, data dictionary)
- Plan for scale, ownership transfer, and data refreshes
- Encourage mentees to think like internal product owners
